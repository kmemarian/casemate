The Casemate model tracks each location with a finite state machine
which encodes the protocol that the location should be following, e.g. _break-before-make_.
This automaton takes steps on each operation:
page table write, TLB maintenace, system register update, and barrier.
When an operation that is not supported by the current state of that location takes place,
the Casemate model indicates a violation of the protocol,
and Casemate reports an error to the user.

****
The Casemate top-level automaton tracks, for each potential page table location,
whether it is _clean_. Unclean locations then require the proper TLB maintenance.

The protocol is hierarchical:
globally, we track whether each page table location has been cleaned enough since previous TLBs to now be writeable;
individually, each thread must follow a sub-protocol to perform the necessary cleaning to transition the global state from unclean to clean.

****
The Casemate cleaning sub-protocol requires a single thread to perform all the necessary cleaning with the correct barriers,
to ensure that the location is seen as clean globally.

To ensure that the automata do not miss transitions due to racy concurrent accesses,
the Casemate model can, optionally, check data race freedom over the page tables
(at a per-tree granularity),
reporting a violation if two threads try to access the same page table tree at the same time.
