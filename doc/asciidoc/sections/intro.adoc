Casemate is a tool for testing systems software use of low-level hardware primitives.

Systems software must often perform low-level operations
which interact with specific hardware mechanisms,
such as cache and TLB maintenance, updating page tables,
updates to the system configuration, and so on.
Software must ensure that particular protocols are observed when doing such an operation,
and failure to do so can result in loss of service or security guarantees.

On Arm, updates to page tables must follow a particular _break-before-make_ protocol.
Failure to do so leads to an unpredictable state which invalidates many of the security guarantees
a hypervisor or operating system, or other such isolation kernel, seek to provide.
Casemate is powered by the Casemate model, which encodes a number of such protocols to monitor and validate
that systems software is correctly following the protocols and to call out violations when they occur.

Casemate has two modes of operation:

* Online: as a library (`casemate-lib`), Casemate can run with the code monitoring accesses and reporting failures at runtime.

* Offline: as an external tool (`casemate-check`), Casemate can check a log file for violations.

Casemate currently supports Arm-A, and the following page table protocols:

* Updating page tables with break-before-make.
  (For both Stage 1 and Stage 2).

* Allocation, zeroing, freeing, and re-use of page tables.

* Context switching between different page tables.

* Thread-local address spaces.
